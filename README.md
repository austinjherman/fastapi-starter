# FastAPI Starter

This is a starter kit for FastAPI. It's got a FastAPI instance running with Postgres and Alembic. It also has a couple of starter routes. 

## Get Started

This repo is meant to be a starting point for larger projects, so to use it, download the code and set up a new repository.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork it and help me. A lot still needs to be done. And I'm not even sure I'm doing this right.
